These log files are broken into their respective categories. For example, the HTTP section contains the logs generated when TCP passes 
a client request up to the application as well as when the server HTTP passes on a message to TCP. 
I have prefixed logs that are travelling up the network stack with a '+' and logs going down the stack with a '-'. 

As the code is not fully implemented and functional, I have made simplifications for the checksum and data fields in the log.

Futhermore, all logs are formated (except HTTP which is plain text) so that header values are in decimal and are seperated
by vertical columns '|'.

Finally, all logs appear in chronological order. For example, the first log for TCP would show the inital values associated with 
recieving the client SYN, the second would show the server respond with a SYN/ACK.
